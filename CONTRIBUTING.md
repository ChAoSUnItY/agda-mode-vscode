After cloning the files, download dependencies and build files with:

```bash
yarn install 
yarn run build
```

Fire up this command to enter the "watch mode" so that you don't have to rebuild stuff manually:

```bash 
yarn run dev
```

Press <kbd>F5</kbd> in VS Code and you should have a extension development host with agda-mode running!
